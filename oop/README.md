# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Programming paradigms are a strategy for reducing code complexity and determining the flow of execution. In this sense, a paradigm can be defined as a style of writing a program. OOP is one of the most widely used paradigms today due to the growing popularity of languages that use it, such as Dart, Java, Kotlin and C++.

> OOP has high modularity, which makes code easier to understand, makes it reusable, adds layers of abstraction and allows for code blocks to be moved between projects.

### Classes
In programming, programmers often try to model the real world. For that, classes with properties that express whatever is important in a system are used. A class is an abstract concept and cannot be used directly, we need to create an object first and then use it.

### Objects 
An object, on the other hand, is a specific instance that you create using a class. Objects are components that store information and have methods to perform operations on this information. Objects can be reused.
