## Decision-making Statements

In Dart, decision-making statements are used to control the flow of execution in a program based on specific conditions. These statements allow the program to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is true or false. Dart provides several types of decision-making statements:

- If
- If-else
- If-else-if
- Switch case
