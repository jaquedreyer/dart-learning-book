# Functions

Dart is a object-oriented language, so functions are also objects and have a type (Function). Function is a set of codes that together perform a specific task. 

## Advantages of functions
- It is used to break the large code into smaller modules and reuse it when needed. 
- Avoid code repetition (helps to write a clean code).
- It makes debugging easier.
