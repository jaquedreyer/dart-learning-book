# Operators

Operators are used to perform mathematical and logical operations on the variables. 

### Arithmetic Operators

| Operator symbol| Description  |
| :-------------:  | -----------|
| +                | Addition     | 
| -                | Subtraction  |

| /                | Division     |   
| ~/               | Division, returning an integer result     | 
| %                | Get the remainder of an integer division (modulo)     |   

### Assignment  operators

| Operator symbol| Description  |
| :-------------:  | -----------|
| =                | Simple assignment     | 
| +=                | Adds a value to a variable  |   
| -=                | Reduces a value to a variable| 
| *=                | Multiply value to a variable |  
| /=                | Divided value by a variable  |  
| ++                | Increment a variable  |  
| --                | Decrement a variable  |  

### Relational  operators

| Operator symbol| Description  |
| :-------------:  | -----------|
| ==      | Equal to      | 
| !=      | Not equal to  |   
| >       | Greater than  | 
| <       | Less than     |  
| >=      | Greater than or equal to |  
| <=      | Less than or equal to  |  

### Logical  operators
| Operator symbol| Description  |
| :-------------:  | -----------|
| &&      | This is ‘and’, return true if all conditions are true | 
| 11     | This is ‘or’. Return true if one of the conditions is true  |   
| !       | This is ’not’. return false if the result is true and vice versa  |
